A component that combines a button or editable field and a drop-down list. The user can select a value from the drop-down list, which appears at the user's request. If you make the combo box editable, then the combo box includes an editable field into which the user can type a value.

Usage: "\\\{\\\{combobox\|id=ANY_UNIQUE_ID\|data={Array}\\\}\\\}"
